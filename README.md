# Mixpanel Demo
##### Push button clickery

In this demo, the instruction to NOT push the button and the button itself are the only elements really.  In the background, the **Mixpanel API** fires off events that are sent out when certain events occur. Some of these events are:

_user pressing the button_
_user pressing the button before the light turns green_
_user pressing the button after the light turns green_

Once the button has been pressed OR a few seconds have passed with no click, a link to a report dashboard with some insights is displayed.
